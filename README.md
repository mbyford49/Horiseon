# Horiseon
The objective of this project was to refactor the code for the website of the marketing agency Horiseon to meet accessibility standards.
This objective was met through the use of semantic html elements following a logical structure, and also consolidating css selectors and properties.
Alt attributes have been added to the image elements. All heading attributes have put in sequential order.
The title element has been changed to give the page a concise yet descriptive title.
The starter code for this website contained a broken link that been fixed. All links on the site now function correctly.
Lastly, all this was acheived with minimal change to the original apperance of the site.
